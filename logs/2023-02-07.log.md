- [ ] 2.1 Unity questions
How did you keep the player in-bounds?
1. What i did to keep my player in bounce was to create a xRange and -xRange so the player can stay in bounce.
What does the variable horizontalInput represent and how do you use it to move your farmer left and right?
2. HorizontalInput represents the player moving left to right and not up and down and i use it to move left and right through my players PlayerController Script.
Why do you think you did transform.Translate in Prototype 2 with horizontalInput but used transform.Rotate with horizontalInput in Prototype 1?
3. I needed to use transform.Rotate in Prototype_1 because in the game I created, my car needed to rotate to be able to avoid the obstacles and for Prototype_2, I needed my player to only move left to right.
