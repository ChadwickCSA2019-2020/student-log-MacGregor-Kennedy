 Explain IN DETAIL how you got the sword to switch directions to match the player. 
 1. I was able to get my sword to switch directions to math the player by setting an attack angle that makes the swordslash slah up, down, left, and right.

How did you complete the challenge in video 7? Again explain IN DETAIL
2. What i did was i ran a git_collision so that if the player hit the bat, then the player would instantly die(but later i set an invTimer so that doesnt happen). Also, i ran 2 new codes for 2 different bats so that in my game, there would be two bats that wpuld deal damage to the player. And the be able for the bats to move, i created a self.speed code so that the bats could move and attack the player.

How did you make it so that the bat randomly "dropped" a gem?
3. What i did as i ran a lootNum = random.randint(0,100)

    if lootNum > 50:
        loot = Gem()
        loot.sprite = sprite('YellowGem.png')
        loot.x = self.x
        loot.y = self.y
This code made the bat drop a gem and for the player to be able to collect the gem
