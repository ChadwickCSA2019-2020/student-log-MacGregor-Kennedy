1. I got the sword to match the direction of the player by setting the attack angle to up, down, left, and right.
2. What i did was i ran a git_collision so that if the player hit the bat, then the player would instantly die(but later i set an invTimer so that doesnt happen). Also i ran 2 new codes for 2 different bats so in my game, there would be two bats that would deal damage to the player. And to be able for the bats to move, i created a self.speed code so that the bats could move and attack players.
3. What i did was i ran a lootNum = random.randint(0,100)

    if lootNum > 50:
        loot = Gem()
        loot.x = self.x
        loot.y = self.y
This code made the bat drop a gem anhd for the player to be able to collect the gem.
