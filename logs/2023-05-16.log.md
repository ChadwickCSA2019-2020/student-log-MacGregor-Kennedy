- [ x ] Fixing the cameras Part 2

- What was the fix for the top-down camera? Explain the process used in the video for debugging the camera to work with the path.
1. The fix for the top-down camera was first change the direction of the top-down mode from a negative to a positive so that the view when we turn wasnt all messed up. We then tps height and distance to adjust the camera's position and we couldve adde da 1.0f to help with the turn.
- What was the fix for the TPS camera? How did we go about slightly tweaking the camera's position and what were the side effects of those tweaks?Â 
2. The fix for TPS Camera was firs twe removed a line of code that said TPS distance on line 2. The side effects were that the camera was less shakey.
- What was the fix for the FPS camera? What's a reason we put in the more complicated code instead of the straightforward playerCar.rotation?
3. The fix for the FPS Camera was we copied and pasted this line of code in the if (raceMode)
transform.rotation = Quaternion.Lerp(transform.rotation, Quaternion.identity, Time.deltaTime * 2f);
We put in more complicated code so that we could play around with our z position instead of using straight forward code.
- What values / tweaks did you make to each of the cameras to give it the feel you wanted? Explain each of your decisions (even if you decided to keep it to the default values, explain why you chose that)
4. The changes i made for each of the cameras to give it a feel i wanted was i 
first made tweaks with my TPS distsnce and height for my hood camera until i could find the right coordinates for my hood camera. Then For my FPS i played around with my z axis so when i turned on my path, my camera wouldnt move from the position the camera started in when i started my game.
