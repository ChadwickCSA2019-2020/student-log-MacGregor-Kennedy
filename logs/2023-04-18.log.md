- [ ] Complete Lesson 5 challege

1. How did you fix the difficulty buttons aesthetic?
I implemented this code to fix this problem,
Debug.Log(button.gameObject.name + " was clicked");
        gameManagerX.StartGame(difficulty);
2. How did you fix the food being destroyed too soon?
I implemented this code to fix this problem in my game,
private void OnMouseDown()
        if (gameManagerX.isGameActive)
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
            gameManagerX.UpdateScore(pointValue);
            Explode();
        }
3. How did you fix the score not displaying properly?
You just have to center the text in our game.
4. How did you fix the restart button?
You make it so it only spawns when the game is over and then you make it so that the difficulty and the buttons work.
5. How did you fix the difficulty button functionality?
I just implemented a public int difficulty in which solved the issue of the difficulty button functionality.
6. How did you implement the timer?
I implemented this code in my game to fix this problem,
 private void Update()


        if (isGameActive)
        {
            timeLeft -= Time.deltaTime;
            timerText.SetText("Time: " + Mathf.Round(timeLeft));
            if(timeLeft < 0)
            {
                GameOver();
            }
        }
