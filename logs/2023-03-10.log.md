- [ ] Complete Challenge 3

1. How did you make it so that you could control the balloon with the spacebar?
What i did was i ran this in my code,
playerRb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
this made it so i could control the baloon with my space bar.
2. How did you fix the background moving?
What i did to fix the background from moving was this,
repeatWidth = GetComponent<BoxCollider>().size.x / 2;
this made it so that the background stopped moving, but looped everytime.
3. How did you fix the objects not spawning?
What i did was i created this,
InvokeRepeating("SpawnObject", startDelay, repeatRate);
this made it so my game knew that this code would implement the objects to spawn.
4. How did you fix the fireworks position?
What i did was i created a public ParticleSystem fireworksParticle; and in my game i changed the numbers on the position on the fireworks.
5. How did you make the background repeat smoothly?
I implemented a float in my code, private float repeatRate = 2;
Thsis made my background repeat when my player has already gone through the first screen.
6. How did you fix the balloon from going too high?
What i did was i created and implemented a private Rigidbody playerRb; so that the baloon or player wasnt going to high
7. How did you make the balloon bounce off the ground instead of going through it?
I implemented through my code to my game by using a floatforce so that the baloon didnt gon through the floor of the game.
