- [ ] Complete Unity 1.2

1. What is Transform in Unity (you should be able to find an answer in the Unity Documentation)
Transform is responsible for position, rotation, and scale manipulation of the object. Each object placed in the Unity scene has some initial position, rotation, and transform.

2. What is Time.deltaTime and how does it impact the movement in your game?
What it does is it shows how much frames per second the oplayer is receiving no matter how many frames they have. They can has 20 to 60 frames.
3. What is a RigidBody and how does it impact collisions in your game

what it does is it applies more mass to your obstacle or your Vehicle so the game can be more challenging. This will also make sure that the vehicle doesnt go straight through the box at a fast speed.# Wednesday, January 25, 2023 08:53 PM
