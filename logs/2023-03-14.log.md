- [ ] Complete Lesson 4.1 

Why did we make the camera a child object of the Focal Point GameObject?
The reason we did this so when we played our game, focal point was set on the main camera because or main camera is our child.
What's the difference between using GetComponent<> and GameObject.Find?
The difference is is that a GetComponent<> is for the player and a GameObject.Find is for any object or thing in the game itself.
Explain IN DETAIL how you got the ball to roll in the direction the camera was facing?
What i did was i first implemented this code into my game, 

float horizontalInput = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");

        transform.Rotate(Vector3.up, horizontalInput * rotationSpeed * Time.deltaTime);

this code represented the ball moving at an up and down movement when the camera was circling around the platform.
