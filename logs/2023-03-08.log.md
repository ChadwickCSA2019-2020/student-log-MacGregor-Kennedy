- [ ] Complete Spawn Manager


1. What was the purpose of swapping the InvokeRepeating for a CoRoutine?
We use spawn coroutine so that when everytime an aminal spawns, it will spawn an animal in a 1-2 second wait time instead of spawning every second
2. How was the optimal Spawn Interval Function found in the video (yes I'm asking you to explain the math)?
It was found when setting the a as maxSpawnInterval and the b as  minSpawnInterval. the C represented smoothingFactor so if the player had a high score, it wouldn't go into the negatives like he said in video 19.
3. How did you implement the Spawn Interval Function into the code?
What i did was i implemented this code,
float time = ScoreManager.instance.GetScore();
        float spawnInterval = ((maxSpawnInterval - minSpawnInterval) / ((time / smoothingFactor) + 1)) + minSpawnInterval;
        return spawnInterval;

and i implemented this,
public float maxSpawnInterval = 2.5f, minSpawnInterval = 0.01f, smoothingFactor = 28.7f;
this code implemented into my game my max, minimum spawn interval and smoothing factor to my unity game.
