- [ ] 2.2 Questions

1. Why do we.make the animals and projectiles prefabs? How does it help us develop our game faster?
It helps our game develop faster so we dont have to worry about the animals flying off our screen. Instead, the animals will be destroyed out of bounds and that why i created a DestroyOutOfBounds script so we can prevent this.
2. How did you make it so that you could fire the projectiles when you press the space bar?
What i did was iu created this if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space))

Instantiate(projectilePrefab, transform.position, projectilePrefab.transform.rotation);
This made sure that my projectile prefab was able to move and rotate in my game.
3. How did you get it so it would destroy objects once they leave the screen?
What i decided to make was a destroy out of bounds script so I could prevent this. I explained a little abouyt this in question 1.
