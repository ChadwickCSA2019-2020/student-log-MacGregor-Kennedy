- [ x ] complete Challenge 4

1. How did you fix the enemy not being hit away from you?
what i did was i inmplented this code,
private float normalStrength = 10; // how hard to hit enemy without powerup
    private float powerupStrength = 25; // how hard to hit enemy with powerup
now the game knows when i hit the other soccer ball, it wont be hit away from me but will go in the goal.

2. How did you fix the wave spawning when you got a new powerup instead of when you removed all the enemies?
We fix this problem by implemeting this code, 
if (other.gameObject.CompareTag("Powerup"))
        {
            Destroy(other.gameObject);
            hasPowerup = true;
            powerupIndicator.SetActive(true);
        }
this made it so that the wave spawning when i got a new power up didnt remove all the enemies.

3. How did you fix the powerup so that it only lasted for a set time?
What i did was i created this line of code so that there was a cooldown,
yield return new WaitForSeconds(powerUpDuration);
        hasPowerup = false;
        powerupIndicator.SetActive(false);
This code was implemented into my game so there was a cooldown for my power up so my game was playable.

4. How did you fix the number of enemies being spawned?
What i did was i implemented this code, 

5. How did you fix the enemies not moving?
What i did was i created this line of code,
private GameObject playerGoal; this made it so that the enemies goal was to go into the goal and also i implemented this,
enemyRb.AddForce(lookDirection * speed * Time.deltaTime); 
this made it so that the enemy was actually moving and had its goal on scoring in the enemies goal.
6. How did you fix the turbo boost?
what i did was i created this line of code,
if (hasPowerup) // if have powerup hit enemy with powerup force
            {
                enemyRigidbody.AddForce(awayFromPlayer * powerupStrength, ForceMode.Impulse);
            }
            else // if no powerup, hit enemy with normal strength 
            {
                enemyRigidbody.AddForce(awayFromPlayer * normalStrength, ForceMode.Impulse);
            }
this code here states that if the player doesnt have the powerup, it wont be able to turbo boost and when it does have a powerup, it will have a turbo boost.

7. How did you make it so the enemies speed increased with each wave?
what i did was i implemented this code into my game so everytime the enemies speed increased with each wave, player.transform.position = new Vector3(0, 1, -7);
player.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().velocity = Vector3.zero;
player.GetComponent<Rigidbody>().angularVelocity = Vector3.zero;
