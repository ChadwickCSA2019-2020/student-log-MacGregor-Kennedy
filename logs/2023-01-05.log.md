How did you set up the mouse pointer? (Explain how you got it to follow the mouse, how you adjusted the hit box, and how you made it invisible)
1. What i did was i set up a code in my game so it made sure that the computer would know that the pointer hitbox would follow my mouse.

Explain how you got your ghost to "choose" a bridge and cross the bridge.
2. What i did was i set up a variable in my game so that it would have a number between 0 and 2 to choose from or in other words choose which bridge to go to.
Explain how you then got the ghost to go to the enemy castle after it crosses the bridge (be sure to explain how your ghost knows it finished crossing the bridge)

Explain how you then got the ghost to go to the enemy castle after it crosses the bridge (be sure to explain how your ghost knows it finished crossing the bridge)
3. What i did was i set up a code for my ghost so it would choose which bridge it would go to in order to get to the enemy castle. In order for me to do this, i set up a x and y axis for my ghost so if my ghost went to the top bridge, it would have to move up to get to it. Once it crosed the bridge, i again set a code up in my game that made sure that the ghost would have a target or ending point to the enemy castle so that the ghost would finish there.
