1. How did you set up the base Score Manager so that the score went up as time went on (video 15)?
What i did was i ran this code through my game,
score = 0;
        running = true;
        ShowText();
        scoreText.gameObject.SetActive(true);
this code made it so when i started my game, it would overtime have my score go up and on top of that i made a public static text,

public static ScoreManager instance;
2. How did you get the final score to show up on the End Screen?
What i did was i ran this code in VS,
endScreenScoreText.gameObject.SetActive(true);
        endScreenScoreText.text = "Score: " + score;
this made it so when the game ended, this code would show the sum of the score in my game.
3. How did you get a high score to show up on the End Screen?
What i did was i ran this code,
highScreenScoreText.gameObject.SetActive(true);
        highScreenScoreText.text = "High Score: " + score;
and i also ran this, 
highScreenScoreText.gameObject.SetActive(false);

this made it so when i got a high score in the game, it would total up the high score and make it my high score in my Unity Game.
