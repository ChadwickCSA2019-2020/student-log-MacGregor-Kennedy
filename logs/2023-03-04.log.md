1. What is a Coroutine and how do we use it in our game?
We use Couroutine to describe Ienumerator instead of void. Couroutine can minipulate the time of the game.
2. How did you set up the particle effects in the scene? What numbers did you decide on for the Playback values?
What i did to set up the particle effects in my game was i added the file for the paticle effects to my assets and then and the numbers i decided on for my playback values were actually default.
3. How did you access the particle effects in your code and activate it from your code?
What i made sure to do is put in this code, 

 public ParticleSystem deathParticleEffect;
 Instantiate(deathParticleEffect, transform.position, transform.rotation);
 this code made my game realize that this code was being axtivated from my VS and so this made sure that my game was able to activate the particles from my code.
