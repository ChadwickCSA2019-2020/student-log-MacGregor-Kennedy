Explain how you set up the combat system so that units could destroy each other
1. What i did was i set up a random timer between 1 and 3 seconds so that the bats didnt spawn at the same time in the same amount of time. This makes sure that the bat has a chance spawning between 1and 3 seconds so it isnt obvious when it spawns.
Explain how you set up the life bars for the Units
What i did first was i added a sprite for the life bar and once i did i made sure the life bar would follow the enemy and player. Once i did that i did this,
self.hpBar.x = self.x 
self.hpBar.y = self.y - 50
self.hpBar.scaleX = self.life/self.maxLife
this code makes sure that my life bar can follow my player so it wouldnt be in the middle of my screen with no x and y base.

Explain how you set up mana to buy units (need to explain setting up the timer, setting the max, and then setting up the functionality to buy a unit)
First, you have to do this,
game.manaTimer = game.manaTimer - 1

if game.manaTimer <= 0:
    if game.mana < game.maxMana:
        game.mana = game.mana + 1
        game.manaTimer = 60
        print(game.mana)

This code makes sure that the game knows that every second is when you can spawn a ghost so that you cant spawn may ghosts at a time. On top of that you also need to do this,
game.mana = 0
game.maxMana = 20
game.manaTimer = 60
this lets the game know that again you can spawn a ghost every second and will have a max mana up to 20 seconds
