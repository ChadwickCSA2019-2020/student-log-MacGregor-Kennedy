How did you get the ghosts to damage the castle?
1. What i did was i ran a code in my game that made my ghost cross the bridge and deal damage to the enemy castle. I first made sure that when the ghost was about to damage the castle, i made sure that the life bar for the castle would go down. So i created a sprite called life bar.png so that it would show how much damage the enemy castle took. After i did that, i made sure that the life bar went down after the ghost hit the enemy base.



Explain how you set up the health bar for the castle
2. ( answered it in question 2)
Explain how you set up the enemy spawner to generate enemies that attack the player castle
3. game.enemyPlayerTimer = game.enemyPlayerTimer - 1
game.enemyPlayerTimer = game.enemyPlayerTimer - 1
This code made sure that the enemy player was able to spawn every 3 seconds in my game.
