1. Describe how you set up the Player Animator Controller
What i did was i went to my assets folder and created a new animator controller in my assets folder.
2. Describe how you changed the Player Animator in the PlayerController.cs file
I did this     anim.SetBool("Walking", false);
        }
        else
        {
            anim.SetBool("Walking", true);
             made sure i said this in my code so that the computer can detect that i have set up a bool("walking", false); and a  ("walking", true);
3. Describe how you set the Animators for your animals. How is it different than setting up the animator for the player?
The reason it is different becuase you have to add a run animation and idle animation for your player and animals so the game can know when the game starts, the amimal will spwan like it is in a running motion.
