1. What are the differences between the four ForceModes and why did we choose Impulse?
The differences are that each forcemode creates this in my code, 
 playerRb.AddForce(Vector3.up * jumpForce, ForceMode.Impulse);
            isOnGround = false;
this shows when everytime im on the ground, there will be a check  mark in my player hierchy showing im on the ground and when im in the air, the chech mark was gone.
2. What values did you choose for gravityModifier, jumpForce, and Rigidbody mass? 
I chose this for gravity modifier 
playerRb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        Physics.gravity *= gravityModifier;
this shows the Physics.gravity equaling and multiplying by the gravity modifier. For jumpforce i chose this
playerRb.AddForce(Vector3.up * jumpForce, ForceMode.Impulse);
and for the rigidbody mass i did this,
playerRb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();

3. How did you prevent the player from double jumping?
What i did was i created a check box so when i was on the ground, the check mark was filled in and when i wasnt on the ground, the check mark was gone. This made my game not let my double jump.

1. How did you get the background to repeat SMOOTHLY? 
 What i did was i created this code in my VS,
 startPos = transform.position;
        repeatWidth = GetComponent<BoxCollider>().size.x / 2;
this made it so my background would repeat everytme when it passed the size of the screen itself in my game.
2. How did you get the game to stop when the game was over? 
What i did was i implemented this code into my game to know it was game over, 
if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Ground"))
        {
            isOnGround = true;
        }
        else if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Obstacle"));
        {
            Debug.Log("Game Over");
            gameOver = true;
this made it so when i collided with an obstacle, the game would know that the game is over.
3. How did you destroy the obstacles that went off the screen?
What i did was i implemented this code into my game,
if (transform.position.x < leftBound && gameObject.CompareTag("Obstacle"))
        {
            Destroy(gameObject);
        }
this made it so when the obstacles flew off the screen, they would be destroyed.

1. How did you set up the jump animaiton?
What i did was i set my speed to 0.7 so my character had enough time to jump over the obstacles in  my game.
2. How did you set up the death animation?
What i did was i went to my death animation in my animator and did this in my code,
playerAnim.SetBool("Death_b", true);
            playerAnim.SetInteger("DeathType_int", 1);
this is what created my death animation and what created my boolean and 
setTrigger.
3. How did you keep the player from unconcious jumping?
What i did was i implemented this code into my game,
if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space) && isOnGround && !gameOver)
this made it so when the game was over, the player didnt keep on jumping over and over again.
