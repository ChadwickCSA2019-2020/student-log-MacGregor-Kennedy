- [ x ] Complete 3.1 In Unity

1. What are the differences between the four ForceModes and why did we choose Impulse?
The differences are that each forcemode creates this in my code, 
 playerRb.AddForce(Vector3.up * jumpForce, ForceMode.Impulse);
            isOnGround = false;
this shows when everytime im on the ground, there will be a check  mark in my player hierchy showing im on the ground and when im in the air, the chech mark was gone.
2. What values did you choose for gravityModifier, jumpForce, and Rigidbody mass? 
I chose this for gravity modifier 
playerRb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        Physics.gravity *= gravityModifier;
this shows the Physics.gravity equaling and multiplying by the gravity modifier. For jumpforce i chose this
playerRb.AddForce(Vector3.up * jumpForce, ForceMode.Impulse);
and for the rigidbody mass i did this,
playerRb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();

3. How did you prevent the player from double jumping?
What i did was i created a check box so when i was on the ground, the check mark was filled in and when i wasnt on the ground, the check mark was gone. This made my game not let my double jump.
