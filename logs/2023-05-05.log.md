- [ ] Complete Assignment for City Racer

1. Explain how you set up your path (go from importing the path creator package to closing the path)
What i did first was i imported ther path creator package and adjusted some code to make it easier to create my path, then i imported my path all the way to the bridge and then i finished the path while going around the entire city.

2. What things did you take into consideration creating your path (e.g. difficulty, amount of turns, length of straightaways)?
I made sure that my path had obstacles and that it was long so that it was enjoyable and had a challenge up ahead.

3. How did you set up your roadblocks to block your path? Explain how you set them to cover the entire width of the street?
What i did to set up the roadblockers was i made sure that it covered up the street but didnt cover it up the whole road so it wasnt impossible to pass through.

- [ ] Loge for May 5th

What code did we need to add to allow our car to turn? What is the purpose of raceMode variable?
What we did nwas we implemented this code,

if (raceMode)
		
			transform.rotation = Quaternion.Lerp(transform.rotation, Quaternion.Euler(rotation, playerCar.eulerAngles.y, 0f), Time.deltaTime * 2f);

			//places the camera at the car's position
			targetPosition = new Vector3(playerCar.position.x, playerCar.position.y, playerCar.position.z);
			//backs ther camera up and points it in the direction of the car
			targetPosition -= transform.rotation * Vector3.forward * distance;

			//adjusts the camera to be in topdown view 
			targetPosition = new Vector3(targetPosition.x, playerCar.position.y + height, targetPosition.z);

What are the different types of cameras in our City Racer game? How do you switch between them (explore the Highway Racer documentation)?


Explain how we set up the first camera in City Racer. Explain each line of code IN DETAIL (yes, talk about the Quaternion and Euler's)
