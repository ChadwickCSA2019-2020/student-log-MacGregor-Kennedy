1. What does the Wrapping setting do for our text?
What it does is it makes us able to have our text just stay horizontal instead of clumping up and going vertical.
2. What is the benefit of writing functions (e.g. GameOver) instead of having all of our code in Start and Update (need AT LEAST two reasons)
2 reasons of why it is a benefit of writing functions in our game is because the use of functions makes a program more readable. Also, it makes it easier for our game to know what code we are writing so the game itself can function.
3. How are we able to use the object SceneManager even though we never defined it in our code or in our game? We are able to define the object SceneManager because it is already apart of Unity, in other words, it already has its own functions and it doesnt need code to define its functions in our game.
