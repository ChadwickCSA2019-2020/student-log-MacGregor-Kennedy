- [ ] Complete 4.2

1. What is a Physics Material?
The Physic Material is used to adjust friction and bouncing effects of colliding objects so that out game can be playable and fun. 
2. What are the different options for Bounce Combine and what do they do?
The different options are minimum, average, multiply, and maximum and what they do is they average, multiply, minimize, or maximize the amount of bounciness that is created in our game.
3. What does it mean to normalize a vector (Step 3)?
Whhat it means is when its normalized, it keeps the same direction but its length is 1.0. Since this is the case, this function will change the current vector. 
4. How did we set it up our method to return a spawn position (2 things)?
What i did was i implemented this code into my game,
private float spawnRange = 9.0f;
this makes the game know that there is a range for each direction set to 9.0.
