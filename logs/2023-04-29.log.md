- [ x ] Complete race UI

1. How did you customize the main menu to fit the new mode and then select the city (also describe bringing in the custom image)?
What i did first was find the right coordinated for the outside barrier for the city 1 then i implemented my city 1 image to replace the already existing one.

2. What is PlayerPrefs and how do we use it in our game?
PlayerPrefs is a class that stores Player preferences between game sessions. It can store string, float and integer values into the user's platform registry.

3. How did you make it so that when you clicked the main menu, it takes you to the city racer (be sure to mention how you edited the code and updated the build settings)?
What i did to make this happen was first i went to the build settings and added a city racer scene and then i implemented this code, public GameObject raceSceneSelectionMenu; andn this ,

GameObject menu = sceneSelectionMenu;
		if (_modeIndex < 4)
		{
			menu = raceSceneSelectionMenu;
		}

		EnableMenu(sceneSelectionMenu);# Saturday, April 29, 2023 03:14 PM
