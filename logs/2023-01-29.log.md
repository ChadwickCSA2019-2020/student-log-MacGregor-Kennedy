1. How did you make the vehicle respond to the arrow keys (left/right and up/down)?
What i did was i created a horizontal and vertical input so the vehicle could move right to left.
2. What's the difference between transform.Translate and transform.Rotate? 
The difference between transform.Translate and transform.Rotate is that transform.Translate only makes sure if the vehicle is moving or not. Transform.rotate makes sure that the car can move left to right and can also stay in a forward movement.
3. What's the difference between making the variables at the top of our code (i.e. our attributes) private vs public?
The difference between making the variables private is so that if i change anything in my inspector, it won't change anything in my script.# Sunday, January 29, 2023 02:55 PM
