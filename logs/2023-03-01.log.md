- [ x ] Complete Death animation

1. How did you set up the Death Animator Controller?
What i did was i chose a death animation and set a "bool" so that the animation was set for the player when it dies.
2. How did you trigger it into the code?
What i did was i triggered my death animation into my player animation controller and i made a transition with Dwath_01 and anystate.
3. How did you adjust how fast the death animation would happen? What numbers did you settle on? 
What i did to adjust how fast i died was i did this 
if (!dead)
        {
            anim.SetTrigger("Death Trigger");
            dead = true;
            Debug.Log("Game Over");
This signaled to my game if the player collided with the animals, it would die and i set it to default instead of settling on numbers.
