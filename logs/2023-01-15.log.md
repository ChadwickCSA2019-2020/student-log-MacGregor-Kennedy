Explain how you set up the mana bar
1. What i did to set up my mana bar was first i added a sprite for it and then made sure my code said that my mana bar had and x and y so that it wouldnt be in the middle of my screen. Next I did this,
game.mana = 20
game.maxMana = 20
game.manaCooldown = 30

this made sure that I didnt spawn a u it every second, instead, it had a cooldown so that the game would be much harder.

Explain how you set up your Victory and Defeat Screens
2. What i did was i created 3 rooms, Play, Victory, and defeat. These rooms were set up so when i loose of win, the computer would know which room to got to when i win or loose. Also, i added this code
defeatText = new_text('DEFEAT',-250,100)
defeatText.color = 'red'
defeatText.fontSize = 150

instructions = new_text('Press space to play again',-300,-270)
instructions.color = 'white'
instructions.fontSize = 50

and

defeatText = new_text('VICTORY',-250,100)
defeatText.color = 'green'
defeatText.fontSize = 150

instructions = new_text('Press space to play again',-300,-270)
instructions.color = 'white'
instructions.fontSize = 50

This code made both of my rooms have a text shown in the middle saying Victory or defeat. I also added the fontSize and color to my screen.
Explain why you declared the spider as a Unit even though it has a different traits (sprite, speed, life) than the ghost
3.  The reason i declared my spider the unit is so that the my game can have a unit that has more health and less speed. I did this so that the game would be fair and be challenging in some aspect or form.# Sunday, January 15, 2023 01:15 PM
