Explain, IN DETAIL, how you got the boss to "hide"
1. What i did was i created a hideTimer so when the 
slime boss was hit by an arrow or sword slash, it would hide for a certain amount of time.

Explain, IN DETAIL, how you set up the slimespawners
2. what i did was i created a self.spawntimer 1, 2, 3, and 4 for my boss room so when the boss was hit the first time and started to hide, the slimespawners would activate slime out of the spawners.

What are global variables and explain(again IN DETAIL) how you used them to finish out your game (should be at least 3 ways, this answer should be pretty long)
3. Global Variables are inside the game and theyre are accessable by every object in the game and i used them to finish my game by setting up a self.playerMaxHealth, self.swordDamage, self.bowDamage, and a self.slimebossDefeated so when the hero defeated the boss, it was able to increase sword damage, increase its max health, and its bow damage.
