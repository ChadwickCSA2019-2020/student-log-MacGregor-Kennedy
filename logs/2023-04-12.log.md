1. What is an Anchor Point and how do we use it in our game?
An anchor point is how it can communicate with TextMeshPro whether we want something to be located always in the center or in any other parts of the screen.
2. What's the difference between Text, TMP_Text, and TextMeshProUGUI?
The TMP_Text class is the parent class of both the TextMeshPro and TextMeshProUGUI in which TMP_Text is like a parent of the TextMeshPro, Text, and the TextMeshProUGUI.
3. What is an alternate way we could've written our code so that we could access the GameManager methods in Target.cs (be specific WITH CODE)?
So an alternate way we couldve approached this was doing this,
private GameManager gameManager; and this, gameManager = GameObject.Find("Game Manager").GetComponent<GameManager>();
