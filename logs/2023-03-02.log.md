1. What is a canvas object? How did you get the Start Screen image to fit on the Canvas?
A canvas object is an object that makes sure that your background is on a type of canvas then floating around somewhere. What i did to fit the start screen on the canvas was i created a UI, or a way to in which i can put my start screen on the canvas.
2. What is the EventSystem and how does it interact with the buttons?
The event system is a system that interacts with buttons and it interacts with buttons by creating a script so that the buttons would be activated when i started the game.

i created a folder for both start and quit and did a SceneManager.LoadScene(PlaySceneName); so that the buttons would activate when the scene startyed and ended.
