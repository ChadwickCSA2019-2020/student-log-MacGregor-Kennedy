- [ x ] Complete start screen

1. What is a canvas object? How did you get the Start Screen image to fit on the Canvas?
A canvas object is an object that makes sure that your background is on a type of canvas then floating around somewhere. What i did to fit the start screen on the canvas was i created a UI, or a way to in which i can put my start screen on the canvas.
2. What is the EventSystem and how does it interact with the buttons?
The event system is a system that interacts with buttons and it interacts with buttons by creating a script so that the buttons would be activated when i started the game.
3. How did you get the start and quit buttons to work?
i created a folder for both start and quit and did a SceneManager.LoadScene(PlaySceneName); so that the buttons would activate when the scene startyed and ended.

- [ x ] Complete Background soung lasers/particles

1. How did you set up the background music to initallly play in the main scene?
What i did was i first added the file to my game and then i made sure that the sound played at the beginning of the game and the way i did that was i added the sound to my start screen so when i started the game, the sound would play automatically.
2. How did you make it so the background music played in all the scenes?
I attached the sound to all my scenes by creating a projectile folder and setting up the sound so that it would play in all of the scenes.
3. How did you get the Laser sound to play from your code?
What i did was i created this in my playercontroller script 

audioSource = GetComponent<AudioSource>();

thsi code made sure that when the game started, this would make sure that my laser sound played from my code.

        
4. How did you fix the bug of the projectile of colliding with the player?
I did this so that the bug didnt happen 

GameObject player = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("Player");
        Collider playerCollider = player.GetComponent<Collider>();

        This solved the issue.
