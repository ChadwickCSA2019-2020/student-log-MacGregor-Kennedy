Describe the process of importing your own castle
1. What i did was i created a class for castle and set a player and enemy base in my game and also set a x and y so they would be on two different sides.

Describe how to bring in a spritesheet as a single sprite and what the three parameters to new_sprite mean
2. What i did was i made sure that i didn't use more than one class to put each sprite in, instead, i sperated each sprite in a singular sprite. What the 3 parameters to new_sprite mean is when there are boundaries to a new sprite so it doesnt go in one direction or goes past a boundary forever.
What does putting game in front of playerBase do? 
3.  What it does is it has the background in the back and has the two castles that are which the enemy and player bases in front of the background.
