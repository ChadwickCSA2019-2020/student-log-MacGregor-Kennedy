Describe what the Transform Window in the top right corner means for each object
1. It shows your x y and z coordinates for each object or vehicle so you can adjust how to position it.
How exactly did you decide to move the cameras (did you use the tools in the game window or did you use the transform panel)? Why did you choose that? What numbers did you settle on? 
2. I decided to move with my w, a, s and d keys to position my camera to where i want it and i settled on the camera position to be right behind the vehicle itself.
What do you think are the advantages of changing the layout to Tall and One-Column?
3. The adantages on having the layout to be tall and one-column is that you could see more of your game instead of whats on the outside of your screen and you can have all your files in one column and not unorganized into 2 or 3 columns.
