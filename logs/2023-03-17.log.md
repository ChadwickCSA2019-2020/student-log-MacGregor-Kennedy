1. Why did we use CompareTag for the Enemy and the Powerup rather than GameObject.Find?
Because Compare tag is only connecting to the objects with the tag of what ever you want and gameObject is just for the game objects.
2. What is an IEnumerator and how doe s it help us in our game?
allows to stop the process at a specific moment, return that part of object and gets back to that point whenever you need it.3. How did you make the powerUp indicator function properly?
From the Library, drag a Powerup object into the scene, rename it “Powerup Indicator”, and edit its scale
Uncheck the “Active” checkbox in the inspector
In PlayerController.cs, declare a new public GameObject powerupIndicator variable, then assign the Powerup Indicator variable in the inspector
When the player collides with the powerup, set the indicator object to Active, then set to Inactive when the powerup expires
In Update(), set the Indicator position to the player’s position + an offset value

1. What are the 3 parts of a for loop header?
The 3 main parts are the keyword For that starts the loop, the condition being tested, and the End For keyword that terminates the loop in our code so it can be impemented into our game.
2. What does FindObjectsOfType return?
What the FindObjectsOfType does in our game is it implements this code,
enemyCount = FindObjectsOfType<Enemy>().Length;

        if (enemyCount == 0)
        {
            waveNumber++;
            SpawnEnemyWave(waveNumber);
        }
this code listed tells us that the FindObjectsOfType is set to the length of our enemy.
3. How did you make it so the number of enemies increased with each new wave?
What i did ws i created this code public int waveNumber = 1;, then i ran a code saying that every enemy that falls off the platform, an extra enemy would spawn once the first enemy flew off the platform.
