- [ x ] Complete 4.3

1. Why did we use CompareTag for the Enemy and the Powerup rather than GameObject.Find?
Because Compare tag is only connecting to the objects with the tag of what ever you want and gameObject is just for the game objects.
2. What is an IEnumerator and how doe s it help us in our game?
allows to stop the process at a specific moment, return that part of object and gets back to that point whenever you need it.3. How did you make the powerUp indicator function properly?
From the Library, drag a Powerup object into the scene, rename it “Powerup Indicator”, and edit its scale
Uncheck the “Active” checkbox in the inspector
In PlayerController.cs, declare a new public GameObject powerupIndicator variable, then assign the Powerup Indicator variable in the inspector
When the player collides with the powerup, set the indicator object to Active, then set to Inactive when the powerup expires
In Update(), set the Indicator position to the player’s position + an offset value
