- [ ] 2.3 Questions

1. Why do we drag in the Prefabs from the Project Window and not the Animal GameObjects from the Hierarchy to the array that spawns the animals? 
It will make it easier to code our game
2. What does Random.Range do and what do the 2 parameters represent?
What it does is it makes a range between -20 and 20 for your animals to spawn in that range.
3. What's the difference between Perspective and Isometric view and why do we change the camera from Perspective to Orthographic?
Perspective and Isometric view makes your game more up and down and orthographic is more flat and straight.
